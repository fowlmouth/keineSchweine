========================
Just a dumb little game

You need to download the game data before you can play:

Just unpack it to the data directory and you should be good to go

### Dependencies

* Nimrod 0.8.15, until this version is released I'm working off Nimrod HEAD
* SFML 2.0 (git), same for SFML and CSFML 
* CSFML 2.0 (git)
* Chipmunk 6.1.1

### How to build?

* `git submodule init`
* `git submodule update`
* `nimrod c -r keineschweine`
